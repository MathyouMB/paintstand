## üíª Features

For my solution to the Developer Intern Challenge, I have created Shopistrate, a theoretical platform where users can create and sell illustrations. User's can purchase, collect, and re-sell the art of other users for higher prices to climb a global wealth leaderboard.

The following is a list of features the platform supports:

* Users can signup or login using their desired email and password
* Users can upload, update, sell, and delete images
* Users can set and update an image's price
* Users cannot update or delete images they did not upload
* Users can search for images to purchase
* Users can purchase images
* Users can set private viewing permissions on their images
* Users can add tags to their images to improve their search visibility

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

<img src="/documentation/setup_logos.png" width="400px">

To set up and configure this application, you can either install the various dependencies as described below or use the provided dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml`. If you plan to use the Docker, skip to [Docker Setup](#-docker-setup).

This project was built using Ruby on Rails and will require you to have <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/04/17/ruby-2-6-3-released/">Ruby 2.6.3</a> and <a href="https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2020/6/17/Rails-6-0-3-2-has-been-released/">Ruby on Rails 6.0.3.2</a>. Additionally you will need PostgreSQL and Redis installed.

Once you have installed the aforementioned technologies, clone this repo and modify `config/database.yml` to match your local PostgreSQL credentials.
```ruby
development:
  <<: *default
  database: image_repository_development
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD

test:
  <<: *default
  database: image_repository_test
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

You will may also need to modify `config/environments/development.rb` and `config/environments/test.rb` to configure redis.

```ruby
  config.cache_store = :redis_store_with_cas, {
    host: 'redis', # Should be 'localhost' if not using docker-compose setup
    port: 6379,
    db: 0,
    namespace: 'cache',
    expires_in: 15.minutes,
    race_condition_ttl: 1
  }
```

After you've properly configured PostgreSQL and Redis run the following commands:
- run `bundle` to install all ruby gems related to the project
- run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to migrate the database and seed it with data
- run `rails s` or `rails server`
- View `localhost:3000` and you should see


<img src="/documentation/rails_success.png">

## üê≥ Docker Setup

<img src="/documentation/docker_logo.png" width="200px">

If you would like to run this app using docker, you will need to verify that the database host name, username, and password in `config/database.yml` match the information found in `docker-compose.yml` 'db' container and that the `redis_store` information in `config/environments/development.rb` matches the information in the 'redis' container.

The host name in `config/database.yml` should match the name of the postgres container ('db') and the host name of the redis_store should match the name of the redis container ('redis').

```ruby
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  #host: db #uncomment this if using docker-compose

development:
  <<: *default
  database: image_repository_development
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

```ruby
db:
    image: postgres:12-alpine
    environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: YOUR_USERNAME
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: YOUR_PASSWORD
    networks:
        - imagerepo
```

Once you've verified all the connections with postgres and redis should be properly configured, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## API Setup

<img src="/documentation/altair_logo.png" width="200px">

For using this API, I strongly recommend <a href="https://altair.sirmuel.design/">Altair GraphQL Client</a>. Altair is capable of seamlessly using files as GraphQL parameters and can dynamically generate the body of your GraphQL requests.

The GraphQL API can be utilized using POST `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

Many of the GraphQL operations will require you to be logged in and submit a valid JWT Token via the `Authentication` header. You can retrieve your JWT Token using the `login` mutation.

You can log in using the credentials:
* **Email**: tester@email.com
* **Password**: tester

<img src="/documentation/screen_login.png" width="600px">

Add the `Authentication` Header:

<img src="/documentation/screen_auth.png" width="600px">

If you do not have a valid JWT token in the Authentication header on specific operations, you will receive this error:

<img src="/documentation/screen_fail.png" width="600px">

## Schema

<img src="/documentation/schema.png" width="800px">

**NOTE:** To store images, I utilized Rails Active Storage. Active Storage uses polymorphic associations. These are represented above using dotted lines.

* **User**: Represents someone who Interacts with the API
  * Relations
    * **Has Many**: Created_Images (Images the user drew)
    * **Has Many**: Owned_Images (Images the user drew or purchased)

    * **price (integer)**: Represents how much it costs for a user to purchase
    * **state (string)**: Represents whether the image is viewable by all users or only its creator
    * **title (string)**: Represents the image's title

* **ImageTag**: Join between mage and Tag for associating specific images with a tags that represent their characteristics
  * Relations
    * **Belongs To**: Image
    * **Belongs To**: Tag

* **Tag**: Represents a characteristic of another entity.
  * Relations
    * **Has Many**: ImageTags
    * **Has Many**: Images (Through ImageTags Join)
  * Attributes
    * **name (string)**: Represents the characteristic of a given tag

* **Purchase**: Represents an Image's purchase or sale

## ‚òÅÔ∏è API

<img src="/documentation/graphql_logo.png" width="200px">

The Shopistrate API is built using GraphQL.

### API Design

In designing this GraphQL API, I choose to follow the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-design-tutorial/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md">guidelines</a> created by the Shopify API Patterns Team (<a href="https://youtu.be/2It9NofBWYg">Described in this 2018 GraphQL Conference talk by Leane Shapton</a>).

One of the Shopify API Patterns team's GraphQL guidelines is to <a href="https://youtu.be/2It9NofBWYg?t=329">Not expose implementation detail in your API design</a>. To follow this guideline, I abstracted out the ImageTags join table from Shopistrate's domain model.

Additionally, to improve the performance of my API and remove multiple unnecessary round trips to datastores from nested GraphQL queries (<a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/solving-the-n-1-problem-for-graphql-through-batching/">the N+1 query problem</a>), I have defined batch loaders using Shopify's <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-batch">GraphQL-Batch gem</a>.

<img src="/documentation/erd.png" width="800px">


### Queries

### Pagination

Queries that return multiple records have been given pagination using the <a href="https://github.com/RenoFi/graphql-pagination">GraphQL Pagination gem</a>.

```ruby
query imageListed($page: Int!, $limit: Int!){
    imageListed(page: $page, limit: $limit){
        collection{
            attachedImageUrl
            description
            id
            price
            title
        }
        metadata{
            currentPage
            limitValue
            totalCount
            totalPages
        }
    }
}
```

## Cache

<img src="/documentation/redis.png" width="200px">

For caching, I utilized Redis using the "cache-aside" caching strategy. I also utilized <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/identity_cache">Shopify's IdentityCache gem</a> to cache models and their relationships.

## üí∞ Payments

All currency in this application is stored as an integer. This is because it is much safer to use integers than deal with the added complexity of floating point numbers.

Additionally all transactions in this application are surrounded in Active Record Transaction blocks to ensure if an error occurs during the transaction, any edited records are rolled back to before the transaction began.

```ruby
 ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
  ::Purchase.create!(
    cost: image.price,
    customer_id: user.id,
    merchant_id: image.owner.id,
    image_id: image.id
  )

  ...
end
```

## üîê Security

All available GraphQL operations have error handling to prevent any internal errors from being exposed to users.

To verify a user's identity, the API uses JWT tokens. A user can receive their JWT Token by using the `login` mutation.

Additionally, all user passwords are hashed using Bcrypt.


## üßπ Linting

<img src="/documentation/rubocop_logo.png" width="200px">

For this project, I utilized RuboCop to enforce many guidelines outlined in the community <a href="https://rubystyle.guide/">Ruby Style Guide</a>. Additionally, I utilized the Shopify RuboCop config to implement the Shopify Ruby Style guidelines described <a href="https://shopify.github.io/ruby-style-guide/">here.</a>

```ruby
require:
    - rubocop-rails
    - rubocop-faker
    - rubocop-rspec
inherit_gem:
    rubocop-shopify: rubocop.yml

```
